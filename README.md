# Buskstop

Buskstop stop is a social media platform for street performers (buskers) and their fans.

## Description

Buskstop is a social media platform for street performers, also known as buskers, to connect with their local fanbases. Buskers can schedule shows by time and location through Google's map API. They are also able to create profiles, where they can link their cashapp in order to receive tips digitally from their followers, rather than relying on them carrying physical bills. Audience members are able to create a seperate kind of profile that lets them follow buskers, and search for new buskers by name and category. They will also be able to see where and when performers are scheduled to play. Performer accounts are also able to access all functions an audience member can.
